# Required Packages
Following packages are necessary in order for those wanting to fork and/pr clone the repository. A virtual enviroment was created beforehand with the packages installed within

• **Virtual Environment**<br> Syntax: python -m venv "name" --> python -m venv .venv (it is industry practise to call the virtual environment venv)<br> _Please make sure to activate the virtual enviroment --> 'name'\Scripts\activate<br>
_
• **Pandas**<br> Syntax pip install pandas<br>

• **Numpy**<br> Syntax: pip install numpy<br>

• **Matplotlib**<br> Syntax: pip install matplotlib<br>

• **TensorFlow**<br> Syntax: pip install tensorflow -- _**Please Note:** Though this repo also uses Keras, Keras is now built into tensorflow how ever one can still install Keras if needed_<br>

• **Scikit-learn**<br>Syntax: pip install scikit-learn<br>
